This example show how to develop autocomplete results for a textbox input using Angular UI directive.


Typeahead:

The typeahead directives provide several attributes:
typeahead-loading  (Defaults: angular.noop) : Binding to a variable that indicates if matches are being retrieved asynchronously.

typeahead-min-length  (Defaults: 1) : Minimal no of characters that needs to be entered before typeahead kicks-in.

typeahead-on-select($item, $model, $label) (Defaults: null) : A callback executed when a match is selected.

typeahead-template-url  : Set custom item template.

About $viewValue:variable that corresponds to the value entered inside the input.
